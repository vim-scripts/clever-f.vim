clever-f.vim extends f, F, t and T mappings for more convenience.  Instead of ;, f is available to repeat after you type f{char} or F{char}.  F after f{char} and F{char} is also available to undo a jump. t{char} and T{char} are ditto. This extension makes a repeat easier and makes you forget the existence of ;. You can use ; for other key mapping.
In addition, you can customize a behavior of the mappings.
